# Journal Entry Template

Use this format when adding a new entry to `data/journal.json`.

```json
{
  "title": "Entry title",
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "body": [
    "Paragraph 1.",
    "Paragraph 2.",
    "Paragraph 3."
  ],
  "topics": ["topic-one", "topic-two"]
}
```

## Tips
- Keep entries short and honest.
- Prefer 2-6 short paragraphs.
- Use topics as your organizational structure.
- Put newest entries near the top of the JSON array.
