        "We cannot know everything, and we cannot control everything yet. Still, we try, and that tension is fascinating.",
        "As humans, we want to control as much as possible while innovating as fast as possible in ways that are inherently uncontrollable.",
        "I understand the fear and uncertainty.",
        "I do find it concerning when people choose a chatbot or avatar over real human connection.",
        "To me, that reflects a deeper societal failure, that people have become so isolated that those outlets are the only way they feel heard and seen.",
        "At the same time, I believe AI can help us advance and explore what it really means to be human, and what humanity is, beyond productivity gains, faster output, or corporate enrichment.",
        "The real question is: How do we evolve as humanity while developing and bringing this potential new life form into existence?",
        "That is the question I look forward to thinking about as we move forward."
